# About
Trusted Digital Repository (TDR) is a term used to refer to a library or archive of digital information objects that has undergone a formal audit of its long-term content management and digital preservation capacity. This helps to assure users of its collections that its data is authentic, trusthworthy and usable.

A TDR audit takes into account a number of technical, organizational, and economic factors to determine whether a given repository can be trusted to deal with long-term threats to the preservation and accesbility of the digital information objects in its care (e.g. datasets, manuscripts, personal papers, business records, photographs, videos, scientific models, datasets, etc).

Three well-known TDR auditing agencies are the Centre for Research Libraries ([CRL](https://www.crl.edu/)), the Research Data Alliance ([RDA](https://www.rd-alliance.org/)), and the International Organization for Standardization ([ISO](https://www.iso.org/home.html)). Organizations may use the requirements from one of these agencies to do a self-audit as a way to gauge their internal readiness and maturity. To achieve a higer-level of crediblity and accountability, an organization will hire auditors certified by CRL, RDA, or ISO to perform an external audit.

* RDA [CoreTrustSeal](CoreTrustSeal-TDR-Requirements_v02_00-2020-2022.pdf) Core Trust Seal
* ISO [16363:2012](https://www.iso.org/standard/56510.html): Space data and information transfer systems â€” Audit and certification of trustworthy digital repositories 


# RDA audited TDRs

There are at least 175 [Core Trust Seal certified TDRs](https://www.coretrustseal.org/why-certification/certified-repositories/) that have been audited by the Research Data Alliance.
