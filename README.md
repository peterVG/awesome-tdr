_ISO 16363:2012 "Space data and information transfer systems -- Audit and certification of trustworthy digital repositories"_

ISO 16363 is an auditing standard for determining the trustworthiness of content stored in a digital repository. It takes into account a number of technical, organizational, and economic factors to determine whether a given repository can be trusted to deal with long-term threats to the discoverability, usability and authenticity of the digital information objects in its care.

# Notes

The ISO 16363 "TDR standard" is based on the ISO 14271 Open Archival Information System standard ("OAIS" see [CCDS 650.0](https://public.ccsds.org/pubs/650x0m2.pdf)) and Trusted Digital Repositories and Audit Checklist ("TRAC" [see CCDS 652.0](http://public.ccsds.org/publications/archive/652x0m1.pdf)). 

The accompanying ISO 16919:2014 standard provides "Requirements for Bodies providing Audit and Certification" (see [CCSDS 652.1](https://public.ccsds.org/Pubs/652x1m2.pdf)).
