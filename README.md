# About
Trusted Digital Repository (TDR) is a term used to refer to a library or archive of digital information objects that has undergone a formal audit of its long-term content management and digital preservation capacity. 

Such audits are typically based on _ISO 16363:2012 "Space data and information transfer systems -- Audit and certification of trustworthy digital repositories"_. This standard takes into account a number of technical, organizational, and economic factors to determine whether a given repository can be trusted to deal with long-term threats to the authenticity, usability, and discoverability of the digital information objects (datasets, manuscripts, personal papers, business records, photographs, videos, scientific models, datasets, etc) in its care.

An ISO 16363 audit  for determining the trustworthiness and durability of the information that is stored long-term in a digital repository is particularly useful for scenarios involving legal evidence, historical accuracy, scientific reproduciblity, verifiable facts, intellectual property, proprietary knowledge, data relevance and ranking, deep learning training, etc..

# Notes

The ISO 16363 "TDR standard" is based on the ISO 14271 Open Archival Information System standard ("OAIS" see [CCDS 650.0](https://public.ccsds.org/pubs/650x0m2.pdf)) and Trusted Digital Repositories and Audit Checklist ("TRAC" [see CCDS 652.0](http://public.ccsds.org/publications/archive/652x0m1.pdf)). 

The accompanying ISO 16919:2014 standard provides "Requirements for Bodies providing Audit and Certification" (see [CCSDS 652.1](https://public.ccsds.org/Pubs/652x1m2.pdf)).

These publications are available for purchase from the [International Organisation for Standardisation](https://www.iso.org/) or as free downloads from the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (see links inline above) which led the standarization efforts immediately preceding ISO formalisation.
